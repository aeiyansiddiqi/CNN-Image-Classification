# 🧠 Image Training with Custom CNN

An end-to-end image classification pipeline using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch with **NumPy** — no deep learning frameworks. Designed for educational purposes and full control over the architecture, the model was trained on 1,000+ images using **Google Colab**. Image preprocessing was handled with **OpenCV**, and training performance was visualized with **Matplotlib**.
